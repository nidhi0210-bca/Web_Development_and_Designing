    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <p>My name is Nidhi Subhash Kulkarni. I have successfully completed the first year of my Bachelor of Computer Applications (BCA) at K.B. Joshi Institute of Information Technology, Pune. I am passionate about technology, programming, and solving real-world problems through innovative solutions.

I have completed certified courses in C, C++, and Python, and recently earned a Python internship certificate for a one-month program. I am eager to gain hands-on experience and am currently open to internship opportunities where I can contribute, learn, and grow as a developer.</p>
